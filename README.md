Data structures and Algorithms
lab1 - create a hashtable with all functions that are inclusive.
lab2 - create an AVL tree that is self-balancing. Also delete function (of node) is included in this algorithm
lab 2,5 - HeapTree
lab 3 - find the secret message by comparing pairs of points that together form one or more straight lines.
Two solutions are presented. 
One with Hashing that does not need to be sorted with a comparator and one with a comparator.
lab4 - Wordladder, find the longest-shortest path
